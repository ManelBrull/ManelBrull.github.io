Let's continue with C sharp. I started developing in this language after attending a conference in my University about how XNA improved game development. At these times I used to program videogames in C++ using SDL and XNA simplified my life. I was quite out-dated, since I focused in java, but Umanick Technologies make me remember this awesome language.

The first project I've been involved is called Umanick Identity SDK. The project simplifies the integration of our main product, Umanick Identity to the clients. Now it's possible to develop an application with full biometric capabilities with a few clicks and some imports. After my colleague left Umanick, I became the main developer and tester of the application.

The second project is Umanick Identity Workbench. We used our own SDK to do a desktop application where we combined the biographic and biometric data to identify people in a very secure manner. We used it in our suite to control access to valuable items of the client. One example is a biometric showcase for jewlery.

At the moment we are developing Umanick Identity Windows Service. It's a lighter version of Umanick identity Workbench which takes control of a fingerprint scanner and takes a sample when detects a finger. Then, we use the sample to identify the person and we show a small view with all the important details.
