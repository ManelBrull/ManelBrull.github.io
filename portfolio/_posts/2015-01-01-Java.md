Let's start with Java, the language I'm most familiar with. I've been developing Java application since I enrolled the university. 

My best application from these times is my PFC, called Software Ecosystem Proposal for Torrent City Hall. In this project we studied the current developing infraestructure and how can we improve it. Then we continue proposing a small framework to increase the efficiency in developing new application. The PFC concludes showing an example application and how the framework improved the development process. The PDF is available here. It's in Spanish, so don't mind to contact me if you need additional details. The code is here.
