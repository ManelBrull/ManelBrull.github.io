		<h3 class="about-me-subtitle"> Software developer </h3>
		<p>
		I love to design and implement software solutions in Java under agile methodologies. I'm a full stack developer
		based in Valencia, Spain. I also have a degree in Computer Science from Universidad Polit&#233;cnica de Valencia.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the moment I'm working at Umanick Technologies where we aim for better patient identification in hospitals. 
		We want a safer health care system where wrong operations due to identification failures does not exist.
		</p>
		<p>
		Nothing bring me more pleasure than improving people's live through my knowledge and my acts. I always find the 
		smile of the people the best reward of my job. That's why I'm very curious and a fast paced learner, you never know
		where the knowledge to make people smile is. 
		</p>
		<p>
		When I have free time I love doing sport and cooking healthy food, only when a good book doesn't fill my entire day.
