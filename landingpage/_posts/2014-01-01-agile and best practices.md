I use Scrum methodology and TDD to provide high quality software. I also make use of design patterns and OO design to improve the readability, comprehension and quality of my code. I know how to use control version systems like git, project management tools like Jira or Trello, continuous integration with Jenkins deploying artifacts to nexus and generating code metrics reports with sonarQube.
