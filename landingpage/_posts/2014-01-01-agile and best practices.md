I use Scrum methodology and TDD to provide high quality software. I also make use of design patterns and OO design to improve the readability, comprehension and quality of my code. I know how to use control version systems like git, project management tools like Jira or Trello, continuous integration with Jenkins and nexus and code metrics with sonarQube.
